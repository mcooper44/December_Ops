# December_Ops
Utilities for operations in that cold cold month.
This is a work in progress held together with twine, duct tape and paperclips.

The primary focus is on: 
- parsing L2F database exports
- populating local database with geocoded address data
- sorting households into routes
- creating the paper artifacts necessary to get things done
